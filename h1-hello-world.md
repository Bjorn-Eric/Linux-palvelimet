# h1 - Hello world!

## Welcome to my nerd jokes page! Feel free to laugh, cringe or cry, either one is fine.

## Best jokes so far:

1. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because the light attracts too many bugs!

2. Why don't mathematicians argue with angles? Because they're always right!

3. Why do Linux users never get lost? Because they always know where root is! ðŸ˜‚

4. How many Linux users does it take to change a light bulb? None. They just configure the darkness to be the new standard. ðŸ˜†
